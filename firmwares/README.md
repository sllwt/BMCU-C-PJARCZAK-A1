## Which firmware folder should I choose here?

**Choose between:** soft_load(A1), standard(A1) or high_force_load(P1S)

---

### standard(A1)

- Recommended for: Bambu Lab A1 (and most other setups) where filament does NOT require high pushing force to load.
- Choose this if: the PTFE tube between the BMCU and the printer is short and relatively straight (low friction).
- Goal: normal load force and standard pressure behavior.

### high_force_load(P1S)

- Recommended for: Bambu Lab P1S (and similar printers/setups) where PTFE routing is long and has multiple bends.
- This mode uses: much stronger motor force during filament loading, and slightly higher pressure/holding behavior during printing to compensate for higher friction.
- Choose this if:
  - you have a P1S (typical long, curved PTFE path), or
  - your PTFE path is long/complex (many bends), even on A1, or
  - you experience loading problems such as rejected/failed load events (most commonly caused by too little pushing force during loading).

### soft_load(A1)

- Recommended for: A1 / A1 Mini users only.
- This mode uses: lower filament loading force than standard(A1).
- Designed for: some BMCU units that use weaker spring variants and therefore do not hold the filament strongly enough during loading, which can cause clicking/grinding noises.
- Choose this if:
  - you use an A1 or A1 Mini, and
  - you hear grinding/clicking during filament loading, and
  - you want to reduce BMCU wear.
- Important:
  - The best solution is still to replace the lever pressure spring with a stronger one.
  - If needed, you can use this firmware package with reduced loading force instead.
- Warning:
  - This mode may cause loading issues, including the printer rejecting the filament because the pushing force is too weak.
  - If that happens, please do NOT report loading problems when using this firmware set.
  - In such a case, switch back to standard(A1) and use a stronger pressure spring.
- Additional note:
  - Some users have absolutely no loading problems with this version.
  - In general, BMCU is less stressed on this mode, so if everything works correctly, it is perfectly fine to keep using it.
  - For example, on my own A1 Mini this mode works extremely well, and this is the version I personally use.

**If you're unsure:**
- Start with standard(A1).
- If loading is inconsistent or gets rejected, switch to high_force_load(P1S).
- If you use an A1 / A1 Mini and hear grinding during loading, try soft_load(A1).

> All modifications by Pawel Jarczak
> Also thanks to everyone on Reddit who tested this firmware on many different BMCU 370C builds.
> Special thanks to Remote-Trash4593 (Reddit) for the huge effort: extensive testing + detailed documentation.

> May compatibility with BambuLab last as long as possible.
> If they ever block this last lifeboat:
> - We should sell our printers and switch brands, defending our right to ownership and choice.
> - When many of us bought these printers, BMCU was supported without restrictions; limits appeared only after purchase.
> - BMCU was a key reason to buy; for many people AMS is too big, too expensive, and still has plenty of issues.
> - The market is full of amazing 3D printers that do not lock users out - and for many of us, a 3D printer is a critical work tool.
> - Open BMCU firmware gives us real freedom, and we should demand that freedom be respected.
